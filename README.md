# EVM - Electronic Voting Machine

This is a project based on the Brazilian electronic voting machine developed by the TSE (Tribunal Superior Eleitoral). It has three action buttons and 10 numeric keys, the candidates are presented on the screen and their numerical spaces, when filled in correctly, present the name, the party of the councilors and mayors and the vice-president in the case of mayors.

# action buttons

The blank button is used when you do not intend to vote for any candidate.

The correct button is used when you want to restart voting for the current position, for example mayor or councilor, not allowing you to return to the previous position.

And finally, the Confirm button to advance to the next position or finish voting.
